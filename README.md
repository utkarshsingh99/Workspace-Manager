# Workspace-Manager
A Firefox extension to save frequently used tabs as Workspaces

## Description
Are you a person with multiple interests in your life?
Then you would understand the pain of having different sets of tabs for the different tasks you do at seperate times.
This extension can identify your open tabs, save them as a new Workspace, so the next time you sit to continue your work, all your links are there with just one click.
The New Tab page will never be the same, since a JARVIS-themed page is waiting for its awesome Tony Stark (you!)
The Workspaces are stored in your Local Extension Storage.
You can also manually add new Workspaces in the New Tab page, and it will automatically provide a title for the link and save it.

## Features:
- Save currently open tabs as a Workspace.
- In the New Tab page, click on any Workspace to open those set of tabs.
- You can also click on an individual link from a Workspace.
- You can manually add a Workspace in the New Tab Page too.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open firefox and search **"about:debugging"**
3. Click on **This Firefox**
4. Click on **Load Temporary Add Ons**
5. Open **Manifest.json** file
6. You will find a small computer-like icon appear at the top right of your browser.
7. Click on the icon to name your Workspace and save it.
7. When you click on New Tab, the custom page will appear with the saved Workspaces.
